# SE-DAY5-Technical-Writing
## 1. How can understanding your audienceâ€™s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
It will help determine the language with which to express yourself in a way they'd easily comprehend.
## 2. What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?
by understanding the audience first of all and to know what they already know or don't know.
## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
By firstly understanding what they already know and what they need to know.
## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
To be clear and concise in our presentation and to diagrams, headings, subheadings or bulleted points to simplify the message.
## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?
This will make for easy understanding of otherwise complex messaging
